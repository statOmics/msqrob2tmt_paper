# Highlights

- Statistical workflows for differential abundance analysis in labelled proteomics.
- Enhanced sensitivity and specificity.
- Flexible modelling for experiments with both simple and complex designs.
- Benchmarked against DEqMS, MSstatsTMT, and msTrawler using two spike-in datasets.
- Transparent and modular workflows through open-source Bioconductor package msqrob2.
